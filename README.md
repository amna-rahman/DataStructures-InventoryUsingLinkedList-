# DataStructures-InventoryUsingLinkedList-
A C++ program that will allow the company to add, remove and update products in their inventory using a linked list.

## Objective:

Suppose you are working as a software developer for a company that sells various types of products. The company wants to keep track of its inventory using a linked list data structure. You are asked to develop a C++ program that will allow the company to add, remove and update products in their inventory using a linked list.
Requirements:

 • You have to use only Linked List data structure for this assignment. Your marks will be deducted if any other data structure is used
• Your program should perform the below mentioned operations on the output console:
    1. Add a new product to the inventory: The user should be able to add a new product to the inventory by providing the product name, product ID, quantity and price.
    2. Remove a product from the inventory: The user should be able to remove a product from the inventory by providing the product ID.
    3. Update a product in the inventory: The user should be able to update the quantity or price of a product in the inventory by providing the product ID.
    4. Display the inventory: The user should be able to view the entire inventory, including the product name, product ID, quantity and price.
    • Your program should be implemented using a linked list data structure, with each node representing a single product in the inventory. Each node should contain product name, product ID, quantity and price.

## Solution Guidelines: 
1) Understand and practice the following topics before developing this assignment::
   Nodes
   List
   Linked List
   Linked List Methods

    2) To save product information, use the Linked List data structure. Each product will be represented by a node.Do not use strcut . You have to implement Node class . Using struct will result in deduction of marks

    3) Your solution should use these classes:

        a. Node class: To save information of each product
        b. Inventory Class: To save all products in linked list
